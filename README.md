### Overview

For this project, I opted for React with Typescript and Vite as the build tool. 

### Technology Stack

- React
- Typescript
- Vite

### Minimal Dependencies

I intentionally kept the project's dependencies to a minimum. Aside from React and Typescript, the only additional library used is Vite for a streamlined development experience. I utilized React's built-in `useState` for state management.

### Future Improvements

Although the current version is optimized for desktop (1440px) and mobile (375px) as per the Figma design, a further breakpont could be introduced to streamline the design for tablets as well.
